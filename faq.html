      <h3>What is Guild?</h3>
      <p>
        Guild is a new internet service that works on behalf of its members to generate revenue from visitors to any of the member
        websites. What
        <a class="inline" href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a> is doing for writers who publish on Medium's site, we are doing for independent website publishers --
        collecting money from viewers and distributing it to publishers.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Can anyone join?</h3>
      <p>
        Anyone with a website may apply for membership but only those that meet our standards will be admitted, and we reserve the
        right to refuse membership to anyone even if they do meet those standards.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>What standards does my site have to meet?</h3>
      <p>
        We apply a set of objective and subjective standards. The objective standards are based on an audit using Google's
        <a class="inline" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>
        tool for performance, responsiveness, and other factors. For special cases, such as specialize interactive sites, we may
        waive certain requirements. Our subjective standards are based mostly on a checklist covering things like offensive
        content, plagiarism, accessibility, etc.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Once approved, is my membership guaranteed forever?</h3>
      <p>
        No. We will be frequently reviewing Guild member sites to ensure that they are continuing to meet our standards. If we uncover
        problems, we will notify you and you may lose your membership.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Does this work for rich interactive content sites?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. In fact we encourage sites to use the latest web technologies to create the best possible experience for visitors. You
        are not constrained by many of the rules that ad networks impose on publisher sites. You are required, however, to
        ensure that the Guild experience for visitors is not affected by your site -- i.e., that Guild paywall pages and
        the Guild certificate tab are visible to visitors in the expected way.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>How much will I earn?</h3>
      <p>
        A good starting point is to use your existing analytics to tell you how many unique monthly visitors your site has. If all
        of these visitors paid for Guild access on your site, you would earn all of the money they paid for access (net of
        fees).
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, some of your visitors will choose not to pay for access. Some of your visitors may have paid for access on a different
        Guild site. And some of the visitor who paid on your site will visit other Guild sites. So your earnings will be
        affected accordingly.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Will the access price for visitors change?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. As the Guild grows, and therefore the value of an access pass grows along with it, we expect to increase the access
        fees. Our goal is that as the Guild grows, earnings for all members should be growing modestly at the same time.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Why don't you offer a recurring subscription option for visitors?</h3>
      <p>
        We may eventually do that. But recurring transactions add complexity in a visitor's decision making process. And while Guild
        pricing is changing, we concluded that it is premature to offer this option now.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Do you help me bring more visitors to my site?</h3>
      <p>
        Eventually we hope this will be the case, but don't count on it. As a Guild member, you will be working in a consortium with
        other members. The Guild reputation will eventually result in consumers seeking out sites that are members. But it
        is better for you to think about Guild membership as being a way to monetize the visitors you are already getting.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Why should I get paid the same as other members if my site's content is better?</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that the value of your content is reflected in the number of visitors you have and how engaged they are. This
        is already reflected within your share of the Guild proceeds.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>When and how do I get paid?</h3>
      <p>
        Distributions are calculated on the first working day on or after the 15th of each month and distributed promptly to members
        using Paypal as long as their share is at least $5. Smaller amounts roll over to the next period.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Which pages should I designate to go inside the Guild?</h3>
      <p>
        It is up to you to decide which of your content should go "inside" the Guild. Typically your home page and other supporting
        content will remain outside. You may prefer to put only your "premium" content pages inside the Guild to keep your
        viewership high. Or you may prefer to put most of all of your content pages inside. It depends on the nature of your
        content and your visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend that you start with only some of your most valuable content and see how your visitors respond. You can add more
        pages later based on what you learn.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>How many page views should I give away for free?</h3>
      <p>
        This is also up to you and will depend on your content and visitors. If your protected content is of very compelling value
        to visitors, you may not want to give any of it away for free, especially if you have left a lot of content outside
        of the Guild as examples for visitors to evaluate your content. On the other hand, as you put more of your content
        inside the Guild, you will probably want to increase the number of free views so that visitors can get a representative
        sampling of your content before being faced with a payment decision.
      </p>

      <h3>Who runs Guild?</h3>
      <p>
        Guild was created and is operated by Hivepoint, Inc., a startup company located in Palo Alto, California.
