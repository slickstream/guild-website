      <h1>How it works</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <p>
        Guild is a single paywall that spans all of its members' websites. When a new visitor to any of these sites arrives on a
        protected page, Guild asks the visitor to purchase an access pass that is valid for all member sites.</p>
      <p>The publisher of that site gets a portion of the purchase immediately and the remainder of the proceeds are distributed
        weekly on a pro-rata basis according to which member sites that user visits and how much content they consume on
        each site.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Why it works</h3>
      <p>
        Access passes are better than subscriptions because consumers are resistant to recurring charges.</p>
      <p>Passes are currently $0.99 for a month and the consumer decides how many months to pay for at once with no fear of
        a recurring charge. Using the latest browser technology, we make the purchase transaction simple and fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        A multi-site paywall means that a single purchase entitles the buyer to access to many different sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        A consistent set of standards across all member sites governing performance and user experience means that more consumers
        will make a purchase because of what they know they will get in return.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Publisher revenue</h3>
      <p>
        Publishers earn money using a micropayment system where they are compensated for conversions and engagement from access pass
        holders.
      </p>
      <p>Every time a visitor purchases a pass on a publisher's site, this "conversion" results in a share of the proceeds being
        added to that publisher's balance.
      </p>
      <p>Once a week until the pass expires, Guild calculates the share of user engagement that has occurred on each member
        site and distributes the appropriate portion of the proceeds accordingly. Each publisher can see exactly where their
        revenue is coming from with all of the data to back it up
      </p>
      <p>
        Guild transfers each publisher's balance to their Paypal account monthly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Publishers can decide on what proportion of their visitors will be affected by Guild. This allows publishers to test out
        Guild on a small fraction of their visitors while they build confidence in this solution.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        The current price for a Guild access pass fee is $0.99 per month for up to 12 months. We expect this price to increase as
        the Guild network grows -- leading to a growing revenue stream for members with good content. Guild takes a 15% fee
        from net proceeds. </p>
